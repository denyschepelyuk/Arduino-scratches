Stopwatch based on Arduino UNO with an attached Funshield. The stopwatch measures the time internally in milliseconds and display the measured values on the 7-segment LED display with 0.1s precision (including the decimal dot, rounding down). The number should be displayed in the regular decadic format (no leading zeros except one right before the decimal dot). The stopwatch is zeroed at the beginning (i.e., displaying only 0.0 aligned right).

Stopwatch Controls
The stopwatch is always in one of three logical states (stopped, running, or lapped). In the stopped state, the internal clock is not advanced and the display is showing the last measured value (this state is also the initial state after boot). In the running state, the internal clock is measuring passed time and the value on the display is updated continuously. In the lapped state, the stopwatch is still running (collecting time), but the display is frozen -- showing the value which was actually when the lapped state was initiated.

Button 1 performs the start/stop function. It has no bearing in the lapped state.
Button 2 freezes/unfreezes (laps/un-laps) the time. It has no bearing on the `stopped`` state.
Button 3 works only in the stopped state and it resets the stopwatch (sets the internal time counter to 0).
